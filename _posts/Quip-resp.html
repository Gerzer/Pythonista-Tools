<p id='dXXACA4qTmn' class='line'>Walt Whitman's <i>I Sing the Body Electric</i> and Edgar Allan Poe's <i>Annabel Lee</i> both have something to say on the matter of defining the soul. Whitman takes the stance that the body and the soul are one and the same, while Poe claims they are two separate entities. These takes on this age-old discussion are represented in each poem respectively.</p>

<p id='dXXACAYnqWy' class='line'>When Whitman says “And if the body were not the soul, what is the soul?” (<i>I Sing the Body Electric</i>, line 8), it is not so much a question as it is a clever way to state an answer; it is a pointed question. That answer? The body and the soul are not just similar, but the exact same entity. When one says something regarding the body, they are also talking about the soul, and vice-versa. When something happens to the soul, the body is affected, and vice-versa.</p>

<p id='dXXACAMGkVl' class='line'>Poe writes, “[No one] Can ever dissever my soul from the soul / of the beautiful Annabel Lee:—” (<i>Annabel Lee</i>, lines 32 and 33), referencing the poem's narrator's lover. This is after describing the death of Annabel Lee, showing Poe's belief that the soul exists forever, therefore inherently making the body and soul different things. They might be similar, but, according to Poe, cannot be the same.</p>

<p id='dXXACA74o8H' class='line'>Poe and Whitman take opposite stances on the issue of the method of existence of the body and the soul, as can be seen in their poems <i>Annabel Lee</i> and <i>I Sing the Body Electric</i>, respectively. Whitman shows this more directly than Poe (<i>Annabel Lee</i>'s statements on this issue are a little harder to discern), but both poets show their beliefs in some way in their respective poems. This is just one manifestation of the eternal debate on the body and the soul.</p>
