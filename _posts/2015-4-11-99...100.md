Wow. Over the course of a mere ten months, Pythonista Tools has earned such popularity that it is about to hit its 100th star on GitHub. That's incredible for such a specialized repository. While 100 may seem like nothing compared to the thousands of stars big repositories like jQuery get, remember that Pythonista Tools caters to a very small percentage of programmers; only programmers who have purchased Pythonista on the iOS App Store and have GitHub accounts and are likely involved in the Pythonista Forums will, chances are, star Pythonista Tools. So to have 100 of these people like Pythonista Tools enough to star the repository is amazing, and everyone who contributed at all should be proud. The repository started out with just four community scripts, and has grown to such an extent that it now has a beautiful website, a blog with an integrated auto-upload system, and *22 times* the number of scripts it originally contained. But nothing is standing still. We have plenty of ideas regarding how to further improve Pythonista Tools, and, of course, many more scripts and tools to add. Just check out the ["Website Plans" issue](https://github.com/Pythonista-Tools/Pythonista-Tools/issues/21) to see some ideas for making the repository even better. We can't wait to see how things play out. But for now, let's see who will be the 100th person to star Pythonista Tools!
